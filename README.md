# Math-Buddy
We are creating a children friendly calculator!

Project Idea - Marcus Jones &amp; Jacob Colver

Math Buddy is a program created for kids, providing a fun and easy to learn way to solve math equations. Math Buddy will also have a user friendly interface that is geared for all kids who are learning simple math. This software specifically makes math fun for kids by involving them in a math based atmosphere that they can easily relate to. Math Buddy will be implemented with a preexisting kid friendly graphical user interface that allows them access to efficient problem solving. Math Buddy will be able to solve various math equations derived from integer user inputs which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the user enters their integer and math problem type they will be presented with a direct solution to their respective input.
